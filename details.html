                <p class="about-text">I received a BA (Honors) Graphic and Communcation Design degree from Central Saint Martins in 2015 and have since worked professionally as a graphic designer and software engineer. My writing practice encompasses life on the internet, theory of disability, and forms of memory; my writing has appeared in The New Inquiry, The Outline, and on my blog. I strive to make my work in all forms clear, informative, and fun.</p>
